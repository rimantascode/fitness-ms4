# UX

![Responsive Views of Home Page](source/responsive.png)


## User Stories

User stories shaped my idea of how to create this project. 

- Owner Goals.
- As admin I want to sell the exercises plans, nutrition Plans, nutrition and exercises products to earn money.
- As a admin I want the customers to register, so that I could keep the customers informed about the latest products.
- As admin I want to send emails about the latest products, so that will ensure returning customers.
- As admin I want the customers to register, so they would no loose the cart content.
- As  admin I want the user to register, so they would only this way would be able access the subscription content.
- As admin I want to add, edit, update, delete the products with the simple form. 


- User Goals
- As a user I can see my purchased products in my profile, so I can keep track for my own records.
- As a user I want to see the ratings of the products , that would helps to choose the product. 
- As a user I can sort the products by the ratings or price.
- As a user I want to buy single products, I need for the exercises.
- As a user I user I want to have the subscription, so that would let me to full content of the site.
- As a user I want can see the product in detail, so that provides more information about the product.


## Design Process

1. **Strategy plane:** The main aim is to build e-commerce website in which the customers would be able to join a fitness community, and purchase exercise plans and merchandise. What do I get in return? The income, If the customers will be registing I will be able to expanding the customers database, and send the newsletter width verias offers.
2. **Scope plane:** Subscription-Based community, user profiles containing information that map to nutrition and/ or exercises plan.
 Product review. 
 Subscription-based payment model.
 Individual item purchase capability.
 Profiles for each customer.
 Are able to sort the products by price and ratings. 
 Authentication and authorisation mechanism for subscribers and administrators. 
3. **Structure plane:** The main page will be representing what is the website about. The products will be desplayd, and the customer will be able to click on the picture and the detailed information will be displayed with an oportunity to buy the item. If the customer will disire to see the exercies plans, then will be asked to buy the subscription, and once it will be activated, the exrecises plans will be seen.
4. **Skeleton plane:** Once the structure plane was in place started to put all together using Figma. In first place I thought to have a big picture in home page, but latter I decided to have a carousel. The grid of the products releated to the fitness dicided to have 4 per column on bigger screens and 2 large and medium, and one culumn on small screens. the cart can be accessed by clicking on the cart. The items in cart displayed in table and have the fucntionality to update and remove the items.
5. **Surface plane:** When I had the idea how the website will look like matched the colors, the most realated to the fitness, when I have done the reasearch on what colours are used in the gym and fitness added those to my website.

**Conclusion** The website look a bit different then in mockup represented, that is because I find adding some thinks or the other make look more simplier and better.

- ![view-the-required-variables](source/heroku-variables.png)
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Your unique
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY your unique
- DATABASE_URL - this will be when you will create the database.
- DOMAIN_URL - Your heroku app url 
- EMAIL_HOST_PASS - recommended to use google service to send emails.
- EMAIL_HOST_USER - recommended to use google service to send emails.
- SECRET_KEY - Generate online one.
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY - Get it from stripe.
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - Get it from stripe. 
- STRIPE_SUB_WEBHOOK - Get it from stripe, but first create webhook pointend.

- `heroku login -i` , and enter the credentials.
- In the terminal, go to deploy section you will see the line similar to this.
- `heroku git:remote -a testing-deploymenta`
- create requirements.txt
- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
- create Prockfile with a capital "P" this is a requirement, and this is what you add in to it `web: gunicorn fitness_ms4.wsgi:application`
- In settings.py add the heroku app address to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
In settings.py add the correct values to AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME and AWS_S3_REGION_NAME.
- and then `git add . ` and `git commit -m"added requirements.txt and Prock files" `
- `git push heroku master`
